\section{Abstract}
This project's goal is to combine different architectures of neural networks to form a functional English/Spanish translator with the ability to detect the input language and translate to the corresponding opposite language. The resulting product combines a convolutional neural network to classify the input language with two sequence to sequence based recurrent neural networks for learning contextually aware translation.
