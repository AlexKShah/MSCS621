This is your take home midterm exam.

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Go to the labs and find the one for RNNs entitled "Character Modeling with RNNs/LSTMs". You will be running a few experiments and will answer a few questions. Remark: The critical thinking and analysis of the questions is usually reflected in your answers; you will be graded by the quality of your answers at my discretion. 

Part 1: Vary the number of hidden units exponentially as follows, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512; compare results of each and answer the following questions:

What happens to the perplexity? Why do you think that is?

What happens to the sentences that it produces? Why do you think that is? How does this relate to the previous question about perplexity?

(feel free to include any tables or plots to support your answers)

 

Part 2: Vary the length of the sequences as follows, 25, 50, and 75; compare results of each and answer the following questions:

What happens to the perplexity? Why do you think that is?

What happens to the quality of the sentences that it produces? Why do you think that is? How does this relate to the previous question about perplexity?

(feel free to include any tables or plots to support your answers)

 

Part 3 (only if you are feeling adventurous, this is totally optional): Change the dataset and empirically find the set of parameters that give you a good model.

Upload a .pdf of your writeup by  Thursday, Oct/19 by midnight. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
