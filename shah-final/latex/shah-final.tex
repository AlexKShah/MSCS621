\section{Strategy}

My strategy to determine which parameters to change was to research and recall the effects of each parameter on the data. For example I knew batch size would have little effect on the end results but may speed up the processing of the dataset, depending on the hardware. Since time was not of the essence to train a few epochs, I decided to focus my attention on other parameters.
